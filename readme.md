# Home Dashboard

Home Dashboard is a personal dashboard website that lets me quickly see stuff I care about easily.

## TODO

* Set up Continuous Integration for www and api
* Set up Continuous Delivery for www and api
* Set up linters? Popeye?
* Update containers to not run as root
* Move Flask to production webserver

## Why?

Gain more experience:
* Maintain a focus on unit testing
* Angular
* Python
* Kubernetes?
* DevOps-y things
 
## Requirements for running (Big mistake!)

* Docker
* Kubernetes
* Helm
* Skaffold
